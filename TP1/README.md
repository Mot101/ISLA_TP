# Report for TP1

During TP1, the construction of a linear regression model was studied. 
In the course of the work, we performed: 
- dataset analysis with the construction of a correlation graph between features
- construction of a linear regression model using statsmodels and processing categorical features
- selection of the best k-linear regression model containing k features for all $k \in \{0, \dots, 8\}$
- Using multiple split-validation options

The solution is presented in the [TP1_report](TP1_report.ipynb) file; the data file is [prostate.data](prostate.date)
